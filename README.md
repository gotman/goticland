History of the goths.

I started designing 'the wander of the goths' in 2012. 
It was my contribution to tribute this famous and extraordinary tribe - the Goths.
I write here about the project on Github to keep some words about it, beacause it is 
already 100% certain that the website will soon be disabled.

I have some serious reasons to do so:

1) The code is obsolete and infunctional

2) User interaction and design are at very low level.

However I still have many positive emotions about this very first web (private) project of mine :)
